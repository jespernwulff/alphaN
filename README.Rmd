## Installation

You can install the development version of alphaN from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jespernwulff/alphaN")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to set the alpha level as a function of sample size. Here, we imagine we have 200 observations and want to run a linear regression with 5 variables in total. Specifically, we want to set the alpha level such that we avoid Lindley's Paradox:

```{r example}
library(alphaN)
set_alpha(200, p = 5)
```
