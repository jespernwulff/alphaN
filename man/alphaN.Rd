\title{Set the alpha level based on sample size for coefficients in a regression models.}
\usage{
alphaN(n, BF = 1, method = "JAB", p = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Sample size}

\item{BF}{Bayes factor you would like to match. 1 to avoid the Lindley Paradox, 3 to achieve moderate evidence and 10 to achieve strong evidence.}

\item{method}{Used for the choice of 'b', currently one of "JAB" or "JAB adj"}

\item{p}{Number of parameters in the model, only required if method="JAB adj"}
}
\value{
Numeric alpha level required to achieve the desired level of evidence.
}
\description{
Set the alpha level based on sample size for coefficients in a regression models.
