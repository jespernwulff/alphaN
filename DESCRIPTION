Description: Sets the alpha level for coefficients in a regression model 
    as a decreasing function of the sample size through the use of 
    Jeffreys' Approximate Bayes factor. You tell 'alphaN' your sample size, 
    and it tells you to which value you must lower alpha to avoid Lindley's 
    Paradox.
